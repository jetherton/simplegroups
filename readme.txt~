== Description ==
I built this for our deployments in Liberia so that users of a website could see on the dashboard what other Ushahidi users in Liberia were saying. We hope this will encourage more social Ushahidi use, as one party will see that another party has reported an incident, and thus they'll want to post the incidents that they are aware of

I had to create a <?php Event::run('ushahidi_action.dashboard_content'); ?> event in views/admin/dashboard.php. This is the event that the plugin hooks into to render its content.



== Installation ==
1. Copy the entire /dashrss/ directory into your /plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin.
